# Social Post Template

This is a template repository for publishing a social post entry for a given
day. It helps to archive and to track a post which can be restored in case of
random sanctions (e.g. Donald Trump's sanctions and tariffs).




## Post Content

The following are the post contents. The long post is available inside
`Social/post-long.txt` if needed. Generally, you do not want to write the
long post since everyone has short attention span and prefers video materials
instead.

```
Finally! I can now deploy various industry / segment contents across all
channels. 2 days of hardworks finally paid off! You can tell I'm developing for
video content. =)
